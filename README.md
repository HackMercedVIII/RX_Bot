# RX_Bot

## :star: Inspiration

-We were inspired by the API called Drug Info and Price History by Robert Nelson.
-We wanted to create a bot that can look up a specific drug, and pull information about the drug (like drug usage/application, and other information about the drug)



## :dart: What it does

Features: 
Drug lookup
Reminder to take medication
Drug Refill reminder
Negative reaction


## :bricks: How we built it

API - Drug Info and Price History By Robert Nelson
Coding Languages - CSS, HTML, JavaScript, 



## :stop_sign: Challenges we ran into

-Couldn’t figure out how to grab the terminal output and put it into the discord server
-The discord bot kept repeating it self (“Interaction already acknowledge”) when given a command. 


## :grin: Accomplishments that we are proud of



## :open_book: What we learned

-We learned that the discord bot isn’t hard to set up but manipulating it to do certain commands is hard.
