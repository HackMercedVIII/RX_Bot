# RX_Bot

## :star: Inspiration

-We were inspired by the API called Drug Info and Price History by Robert Nelson.
-We wanted to create a bot that can look up a specific drug, and pull information about the drug (like drug usage/application, brand and generic name, and other information.)


## :dart: What it does

Features: 
Drug lookup<br>
Reminder system for taking medication<br>
Drug Refill reminder<br>
Negative reactions with other drugs


## :bricks: How we built it

API - Drug Info and Price History By Robert Nelson
Coding Languages - CSS, HTML, JavaScript, 



## :stop_sign: Challenges we ran into

-Couldn’t figure out how to grab the terminal output and put it into the discord server. The data coming back was in a strange filetype that we couldn't figure out.<br>
-The discord bot kept repeating it self (“Interaction already acknowledge”) when given a command. This was caused by a specific piece of code that, when removed, fixed the issue. We do not understand why. <br>
-After a while, the API we chose stopped working and we began recieving an error stating that the API was unavailable even though on RapidAPI, it was able to be accessed.



## :grin: Accomplishments that we are proud of

-Despite this being mostly our first hackathon, we were able to finish all of the setup and end with a bot that, while unfinished, is still functional with basic commands.

## :open_book: What we learned

-We learned that the discord bot isn’t hard to set up but manipulating it to do certain commands is hard.
